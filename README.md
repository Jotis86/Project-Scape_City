## 📜 Description

This project is an interactive city escape game implemented with Streamlit. The goal of the game is to explore different locations in the city, collect items, and find a way to escape.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop an interactive city escape game where players must explore different locations, collect items, and find a way to escape. The game is implemented using Streamlit to create an interactive web interface.

## ⚙️ Functionality

- 🌍 Explore different locations in the city.
- 🗺️ Collect items and maps to unlock new areas.
- 🛳️ Find a way to reach the port and escape on the ferry.
- ⏱️ 5-minute timer to complete the game.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- 🐍 **Python**: Main programming language.
- 🌐 **Streamlit**: Framework for creating interactive web applications.
- 🧵 **Threading**: To handle the game timer.
- 🗂️ **Git**: Version control.
- 💻 **Visual Studio Code**: Code editor.
- 📓 **Google Colab**: Online Jupyter notebook environment.
- 📘 **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive computing environment.

## 🏗️ Development Process

1. 📝 **Planning**: Defining the functionalities and structure of the game.
2. 💻 **Implementation**: Developing the code for locations, items, and game logic.
3. 🎨 **User Interface**: Creating the web interface using Streamlit.
4. 🧪 **Testing**: Verifying the game's functionality and fixing bugs.
